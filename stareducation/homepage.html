        <p class="sectiontag text-big">The End of Illitracy is Here!</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Illiteracy means “lack of education’ inability to read and write” which is destroying societies like a scourge. Illiteracy is no doubt a curse for a living nation. Nations can come to end if the percentage of illiteracy is higher. An illiterate person is unable to find right way for him; as a result he becomes the slave of others who use him like a puppet. Instead, a literate person can understand that what is right for him and what is wrong. A main cause of poverty is also illiteracy because poverty born from an illiterate 
            <br> <br>
            Nothing is important than education because an educated and literate person can mange things more precisely. Our society must understand this fact. Many tribes and illiterate societies restrict girls to learn reading and writing, such societies are actually a scourge for the whole nation. Many poor nations are now slaves of other nations just because of very low literacy level. An illiterate man is more vulnerable to poverty, hunger, slavery and diseases. Diseases spread due to unawareness and unawareness is the result of illiteracy.
            <br>      <br>
            The effects of illiteracy are infinite, there is no limitation of harms of illiteracy but the problem is that people don’t understand it well. Even the educated people do not want their daughters and sister to get necessary education. No doubt that world literacy level is increased but still there are some countries where literacy level is below the average. These countries are more vulnerable to war and slavery.
